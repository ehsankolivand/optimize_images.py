# üñºÔ∏è Smart WebP Converter


A high-performance, intelligent image converter that automatically optimizes and converts JPEG/PNG images to WebP format. The script ensures optimal compression while maintaining image quality through smart analysis and parallel processing.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Smart Conversion**: Only converts images when the WebP version will be smaller than the original
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains a 95% similarity threshold compared to the original image
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multiple CPU cores for faster batch processing
- **Transparency Support**: Special handling for images with alpha channels
- **Intelligent Quality Selection**: Automatically tests multiple quality settings to find the optimal balance
- **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging of the conversion process with status updates
- **Non-destructive**: Original files are only removed after successful conversion

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pillow (PIL Fork)
- Standard Python libraries: os, sys, pathlib, concurrent.futures, io, logging

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-webp-converter.git
cd smart-webp-converter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## üíª Usage

Simply run the script in the directory containing your images:

```bash
python webp_converter.py
```

The script will:
1. Recursively find all JPG/JPEG/PNG images in the current directory and subdirectories
2. Analyze each image for potential optimization
3. Convert suitable images to WebP format
4. Provide detailed conversion statistics upon completion

### Example Output:
```
2024-01-05 10:30:15 - INFO - Starting image optimization in: /path/to/images
2024-01-05 10:30:15 - INFO - Found 25 images to process
2024-01-05 10:30:16 - INFO - [1/25] Converted image1.jpg: 65.3% smaller
2024-01-05 10:30:16 - INFO - [2/25] Skipped conversion (not beneficial)
...
2024-01-05 10:30:20 - INFO - Optimization Complete!
2024-01-05 10:30:20 - INFO - Successfully converted: 20
2024-01-05 10:30:20 - INFO - Skipped (not beneficial): 4
2024-01-05 10:30:20 - INFO - Errors: 1
```

## üîß How It Works

The script employs a sophisticated approach to image conversion:

1. **Image Analysis**:
   - Reads the original image and calculates its size
   - Determines if the image has transparency
   - Converts image to appropriate color mode (RGB/RGBA)

2. **Optimization Process**:
   - For transparent images: Uses lossless WebP conversion
   - For regular images: Tests multiple quality settings (90, 85, 80)
   - Performs structural similarity analysis to ensure quality preservation
   - Only proceeds with conversion if file size reduction is achieved

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Utilizes ProcessPoolExecutor for concurrent image processing
   - Automatically scales to available CPU cores
   - Maintains organized logging despite parallel execution

4. **Quality Control**:
   - Implements pixel-by-pixel comparison between original and converted images
   - Ensures minimum 95% structural similarity
   - Validates successful conversion before removing original files
